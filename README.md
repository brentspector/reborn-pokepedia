Reborn Pokepedia allows players to filter for pokemon that are available based on their progress in game. It will show all wild, event, and gift pokemon that can be obtained at a given point in the game, and details what moves, tutors, and TM/HM are available to them.

This application is available on web, iOS, and Android.

**Available for both iOS and Android.**
