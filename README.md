## Introduction

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/gitpoint/git-point.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/gitpoint/git-point)
[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

Reborn Pokepedia allows players to filter for pokemon that are available based on their progress in game. It will show all wild, event, and gift pokemon that can be obtained at a given point in the game, and details what moves, tutors, and TM/HM are available to them.

This application is available on web, iOS, and Android.

**Available for both iOS and Android.**

## Features

A few of the things you can do with Reborn Pokepedia:

- Look up pokemon by major battle (Gym, Rival, PULSE, or Major NPC)

## Feedback

Feel free to send us feedback by [Email](brent.spector@yahoo.com) or [file an issue](https://github.com/brentspector/reborn-pokepedia/issues/new). Feature requests are always welcome, although not guaranteed to be fulfilled. If you wish to contribute, please submit a pull request.

## Build Process

- Follow the [Ionic Guide](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment) for getting started building the project. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `ionic serve` to spin up the web-app
- `ionic capacitor open ios` requires appropriate setup in a [Mac Environment](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/ios)
- `ionic capacitor open andriod` requires appropriate setup with [Android Studio](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/android)

### Production Build

Any commit to the `master` branch triggers a Github Action that rebuilds the project and updates https://brentspector.github.io/reborn-pokepedia/.

However, if you wish to preview the production build locally, a Dockerfile has been created to do just that!

From the project root, run the following commands

```
scripts/docker_build.sh
scripts/docker_run.sh
```

Then navigate to `localhost:8080` to see the product.

## Single File Component

Vue.js recommends combining HTML, CSS, and Javascript into one file, represented with the `.vue` file extension. More details on the rationale behind this can be found at https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/single-file-component.html#how-it-works

## Pokemon Data

Data has been broken down into each generation, and some generations have been broken down into multiple portions. This is due to Babel (a compatibility library) deoptimizing files that exceed 500 kB. In order to keep build times short, files should be less than 500 kB if possible.

## Committing

Run `npm run commit` to automatically use `Commitizen`.
